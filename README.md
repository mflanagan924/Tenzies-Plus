## Instructions

Try matching the country flag to the country name. This game is not as easy as it seems because it is testing you on flags that look very similar.

* The objective of the game is to match all ten dice to a chosen target number as quickly as possible.
* Click "Roll" to start game.
* Select target number: At the beginning of each round, the player selects a target number between 1 and 6. This number will be the number they aim to match on all ten dice.
* Match the target number: After the dice are rolled, any dice that match the target number are automatically highlighted or removed from the screen. The remaining dice are left for the next roll.
* Re-rolling: Click the "Roll" button again to roll the remaining dice that didn't match the target number in the previous roll.
* Continuous rolling: Keep rolling the dice and removing the matching ones until all ten dice are successfully matched to the target number.
* Winning: Once all ten dice are matched to the target number, a congratulatory message or animation is displayed, indicating that the player has won the round.
* Press "Restart" to restart the current game.
* Press "Reset" to reset the high score.
* You can press the up or down arrows at the top to change the number of dice between 5 and 15.
